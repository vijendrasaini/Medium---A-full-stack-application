        <p id="c6cf" data-selectable-paragraph="">For most of my 20s and 30s, I thought of happiness as the prize at the
            bottom
            of a Crackerjack box. You wouldn’t bother with the journey unless something special awaited you at the end.
            And then once you reached it, the joy would be fleeting.</p>
        <p id="d732" data-selectable-paragraph="">My first job out of college was an example of this thinking. I worked
            12 hour
            days for a salary of $26,000 (low, even for the 90s). In exchange for leasing out my life, they promised
            frequent promotions.</p>
        <p id="087d" data-selectable-paragraph="">The first one came five months later, along with a $1,000 salary bump.
            I was
            ecstatic for about three days. The misery soon returned, and the cycle continued.</p>
        <p id="08c3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Happiness is not a prize at the bottom of a crackerjack box, cresting
            and
            crashing at each destination. It’s a snack to enjoy on the ride, no matter what awaits you at the end. That
            realization led to my first of seven mindset shifts.</p>

        <p id="ae4a" <!-- data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s dive into Dalio’s three levels of reality…</p> -->
        <h1 id="960b" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong className="ba">Reality Level 1: Getting Stuff Done</strong>
        </h1>
        <p id="474d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Most people operate in this realm. The output of a good sales call is
            a closed
            sale. The outcome of a good meeting is the resolution of a specific problem. Conversely, a bad sales call is
            one that doesn’t result in a new customer. A bad meeting is one that decides nothing.</p>
        <p id="770d" data-selectable-paragraph="">This level of reality is essentially about getting stuff done:
            creating a to-do
            list from most important to least important and then kicking butt right on down the list. Dalio calls this
            layer of reality the blizzard because lots of things are constantly coming at you from different directions,
            and it’s hard to get clarity on what really matters.</p>
        <p id="424b" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dalio’s book is not written on this level. Most books are.</p>
        <h1 id="43b2" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong className="ba">Reality Level 2: Principles</strong></h1>
        <p id="ba8c" data-selectable-paragraph="">To people like Dalio, the value of an activity isn’t just its
            immediate result,
            but also the underlying principles at play. <mark className="apd aia hm">The principles you learn in any
                situation are often more valuable than the immediate result, because you can apply them for the rest of
                your life across all areas to make better decisions.</mark></p>
        <p id="fb96" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, let’s say you’re a salesperson. At Level 2, each sales
            call is an
            opportunity to learn about related principles on multiple levels:</p>

                href="/the-mission/how-to-tell-if-someone-is-truly-smart-or-just-average-a2f0bcac5db2">fundamental
                mental models</a> of what selling is and how it works, you gets closer to principles that are more
            timeless and universal.</p>
        <p id="d84f" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once you reach the “timeless and universal” level, you can apply a
            principle or
            mental model to exponentially more situations. And this is the key here. Once you reach an understanding of
            a mental model, you have a tool that can apply in many situations now and in the future to help you be more
            efficient, get more done, make better decisions, have better relationships, become more successful, and
            become more impactful.</p>
        <p id="af89" data-selectable-paragraph="">Let’s take Stephen Covey’s fundamental principle of ‘Seek first to
            understand
            and then to be understood’ as an example. This principle can help you sell a product, but it can also help
            you be a better parent, have a happier marriage, enjoy deeper friendships, and get along with people of
            different cultures, faiths, and political backgrounds. <strong className="nb gd">If you’re interested in
                learning more about the value of fundamental principles and mental models, I wrote about it in
            </strong><a className="au wp" rel="noopener"

                    className="nb gd">How To Tell If Someone Is Truly Smart Or Just Average</strong></a><strong
                className="nb gd">.</strong></p>
        <p id="700e" data-selectable-paragraph="">So let’s say you have a sales call where the prospect doesn’t buy from
            and
            become a customer. If you operated from Level 1 of reality, this call would be a painful waste of time. To
            Dalio, at Level 2, it would be a learning opportunity because of his following core principle:</p>
        <blockquote className="akq akr aks">
            <p id="7544" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Pain + Reflection = Progress.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="64ae" data-selectable-paragraph="">As he explains:</p>
        <blockquote className="akq akr aks">
            <p id="c56c" data-selectable-paragraph="">“There’s so much more that you can learn from mistakes because
                they give
                you a loud signal. Rewards keep you doing the same things, and so you don’t grow from successes…
                Mistakes, if you can deal with them the right way, with reflection is where the growth comes from.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="b93d" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dalio’s approach is counterintuitive on two levels. First, society
            typically
            judges success by first-order results (i.e., immediate sales), not second-order ones (i.e., improving the
            system that makes sales). Secondly, our natural reaction to pain is to resist it and react emotionally.
            Dalio has built systems, tools, and habits that help him move toward pain, react logically and objectively,
            and engage in thoughtful disagreement rather than arguments, which I’ll explain later in the article. While
            we all intellectually understand that we can learn from pain, I’ve never come across someone who is as
            systematic and committed to it as Dalio.</p>
        <p id="961a" data-selectable-paragraph="">While Level 1 of reality is a blizzard, Level 2 is more like standing
            on a
            mountaintop in a clear sky looking down at the blizzard.</p>

            connections more naturally. Dalio explains:</p>
        <blockquote className="akq akr aks">
            <p id="0f02" data-selectable-paragraph="">“With time and experience, I came to see each encounter as
                ‘another one of
                those’ that I could approach more calmly and analytically, like a biologist might approach an encounter
                with a threatening creature in the jungle: first identifying its species and then, drawing on his prior
                knowledge about its expected behaviors, reacting appropriately. When I was faced with types of
                situations I had encountered before, I drew on the principles I had learned for dealing with them. But
                when I ran into ones I hadn’t seen before, I would be painfully surprised. Studying all those painful
                first-time encounters, I learned that even if they hadn’t happened to me, most of them had happened to
                other people in other times and places, which gave me a healthy respect for history, a hunger to have a
                universal understanding of how reality works, and the desire to build timeless and universal principles
                for dealing with it.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="de4a" data-selectable-paragraph="">While we all learn from our experiences at some level, what separates
            Dalio is
            two things. First, he doesn’t just pull from his own seven decades of personal experience. He attempts to
            pull from all experiences of recorded history<strong className="nb gd">. </strong>This approach gives him a
            tremendous advantage as investor because some financial cycles happen every few months or few years, but
            other cycles only happen every few decades or every century. With Dalio’s wider lens, he can see those
            patterns. Our own personal experiences are a drop in the ocean of humanity’s experiences through all time.

            people learn quickly in new situations, but soon plateau after they’re “good enough” and never get better
            with more experience. This has been heavily studied in the professional world, and it’s evident in our daily
            lives. Has driving more made you a better driver? Has typing more made you a better typist?</p>

            the level which <a className="au wp"

        </div>

        <p id="8d1e" data-selectable-paragraph="">In building these apps and collecting the data from them, Bridgewater
            may have
            built the largest database of team interaction ever in the history of mankind.</p>

        fp"
        data-selectable-paragraph="">Bridgewater, of course, doesn’t just focus on employee emotions, but also on
        their investments. Starting in the 1970s, Dalio created investment algorithms and turned them into code.
        Over time, he improved the code in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="dc8b" data-selectable-paragraph="">As he and his team learned more principles, they turned those
                into
                algorithms, and then turned those into code.</li>
            <li id="9db5" data-selectable-paragraph="">He and his team stress-tested the algorithms using historical
                data. In
                other words, he fed historical data into the program. Then, he let his algorithm run loose to see what
                decisions it would’ve made in that historical context. With the gift of hindsight, he was able to see
                the actual amount of money the algorithm would’ve made or lost without risking a penny.</li>
            <li id="fa5b" data-selectable-paragraph="">With the results from stress-testing, he and his team refined the
                principles, algorithms, and code.</li>
        </ul>
        <p id="bb6d" data-selectable-paragraph="">As Bridgewater got better and better results, they trusted the system
            more and
            more, and started using it to help make real-world investment decisions. Over time, the algorithms have
            become effective enough for Bridgewater to trust its decisions 98 percent of the time.</p>
        <p id="5902" data-selectable-paragraph="">In short, at Level 3, Dalio doesn’t just let the general principles of
            Level 2
            remain general principles. He systematically understands how the principles interact with each other to
            create specific results in the world:</p>
        <blockquote className="akq akr aks">
            <p id="8202" data-selectable-paragraph="">“Visualizing complex systems as machines, figuring out the
                cause-effect
                relationships within them, writing down the principles for dealing with them, and feeding them into a
                computer so the computer could ‘make decisions’ for me all became standard practices.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p id="3aad" data-selectable-paragraph="">Dalio’s approach sparks controversy among many: “What about the chaos
            and
            randomness of life? You can’t reduce complex decisions or dynamics between people into engineering
            problems!” This is where it’s important to understand that Dalio doesn’t claim to have a perfect machine
            that does everything perfectly without humans. Dalio views his machine as a trusted advisor to human
            decision-making.</p>
        <p id="40f1" data-selectable-paragraph="">Naturally, Dalio has immense financial and human resources to build
            his
            machines. But we can still learn from and emulate his approach. For example, Dalio’s approaches have had a
            huge impact on me in two ways:</p>
        <ul>
            <li id="9d72" data-selectable-paragraph="">After reading his work, I realized I had a pervasive pattern of
                ignoring
                painful problems or only dealing with them once they blew up. So, I started logging problems, doing a
                weekly root cause analysis conversation with my wife, with myself, and with our team.</li>
            <li id="59b3" data-selectable-paragraph="">Rather than just being a writer, our company created an idea
                machine where
                we systematically found principles of how quality ideas are created and how they spread. We
                stress-tested those principles with <a className="au wp" rel="noopener"
                    href="/the-mission/forget-about-the-10-000-hour-rule-7b7a39343523">lots of experimentation</a>, and
                then built systems and tools to help the process. Starting with very little profile and no list, my
                writing has been seen nearly 15 million times across platforms in the last 3 years with just a few dozen
